                <h1>Interesting Findings & Information</h1>
                <h3>Realiability of Hurricane Records</h3>
                <p>Data about hurricanes along the years has become more accurate with the development of newer technologies and more points of observation. Although, as stated in [REAL], its highly confined structure nature requires the observation point to be at the right place on the right time. Moreover, there are not a lot of observation points in open oceans were hurricanes spent most of their life.</p>  
                <p>Regarding the hurricane category (based on the SSHWS scale), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) have used different ways for measuring them. "Currently, the SSHWS category assignment is based on wind speed from 1851-1930 and 1990-2010 and on a combination of wind, pressure and storm surge from 1931-1989. Heavy rainfall associated with a hurricane was not one of the criteria used in the categorization”[BLAKE2011].</p>
                <p>Regarding the data, the datasets have missing data for wind speed, minimum pressure and radius of impact for different wind intensity. Even recent events have some missing data on certain information points.</p>
                <p>Although the datasets have this issues, it provides interesting information to display interactive visualizations and study these phenomenons. However, the historical data can stay constantly under reviews and corrections as scientists agree on definitions and new measuring methods are introduced in the scene.</p>
                
                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    Information about methods and technology used for tracking hurricanes in the 19th century is not that spread among the Internet. Thus, the following list will show items regarding important science & technology developments in hurricane tracking:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1914: After the opening of the canal of Panama, new ship routes allowed changes in ship track patterns.[REAL]</li>
                    <li>1944: Reconnaissance Aircrafts were first used during the WWII as pilots went into the eyes of hurricanes to gather information. Nowadays, special drones are also used with this purpose.</li>
                    <li>1957: Radars allow to detect the concentration of precipitation based on the reflected radiation. In 1957, the U.S Weather Bureau established the first radar network to warn about tropical cyclones, but it was during the WWII that radar technicians noticed that "ghost echoes" on their tracking scopes were produced by thunderstorms. Thus, alerting meteorologists about the importance of radas in studying weather.[HURSCIENCE]</li>
                    <li>1960: TIROS was the first satellite used by the United States for monitoring weather conditions. Satellites pictures can be put in motion to get information about the track and intensity of the hurricane.[WEATHER]</li>
                    <li>1990: Doppler radars allow to detect precipitation information of tropical storms. Modern developments have allowed to also detect atmospheric movement (radial velocity).
                    </li>
                    <li>2002: The NASA QuickSCAT observation satellite allowed to measure the surface wind speed and direction over ice-free oceans. It carried a scatterometer allow new advanced microwave sounding technology.[QUICK] </li>
                    <li>2013: Radars were updated acrossed the US radar networks with dual-polarization technology. The new horizontal and vertical pulses allowed to obtain pictures with greater detail in its size and shape.[HURSCIENCE]</li>

                <h3>Interesting Hurricanes Facts</h3>
                <h1>Katrina (08/23/2005 - 08/31/2005)</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hurricane Katrina is the third most deadly (aprox. 1200 fatalities) and costliest landfalling hurricane in the history of the United States.</li>
                    <li>The amount of fatalities caused by Katrina is approximately a 0.26% of the average of fatalities from the Bhola Cyclone (India-Bangladesh, 1970).</li>
                    <li>Katrina became a Category 5 Hurricane while entering the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 3 after hitting Louisiana. At that time, New Orleans levees were designed to deal with at most Category 3 Hurricanes; almost 80% of the city was underwater after the hit.</li>
                    <li>Katrina was the last hurricane to have flooded New Orleans (1915, 1940, 1947, 1965, 1969, 2005).[KHIS]</li>
                    <li>Katrina’s economic impacts are estimated in about $108 billion [BLAKE11]. </li>
